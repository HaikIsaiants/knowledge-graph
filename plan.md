## Section 5: Critical Bug Fixes & System Stabilization

### 5.1 Database Schema Issues - CRITICAL
**Problem**: PostgreSQL enum type `node_type` causing SQL errors when querying nodes by type
- **Error**: `operator does not exist: kg.node_type = character varying`
- **Root Cause**: JPA/Hibernate trying to compare custom enum type with VARCHAR parameter
- **Fix Required**:
  - Convert `node_type` column from enum to VARCHAR in database
  - Or add explicit type casting in queries: `CAST(? AS kg.node_type)`
  - Update all repository methods using node type filtering
  - Test with integration tests to verify fix

### 5.2 Missing NodeType Enum Values - HIGH
**Problem**: Frontend requests node types that don't exist in backend enum
- **Missing Types**: `LOCATION`, `PROJECT` 
- **Current Types**: `ENTITY`, `CONCEPT`, `SECTION`, `REFERENCE`, `NOTE`, `SYSTEM`, `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, `EVENT`, `PLACE`, `ITEM`, `DOCUMENT`
- **Fix Required**:
  - Add missing types to `NodeType.java` enum
  - Or remove these types from frontend requests
  - Ensure frontend and backend enums are synchronized
  - Add validation test to prevent future mismatches

### 5.3 Search Functionality Broken - CRITICAL
**Problem**: All search endpoints returning 500 errors
- **Affected Endpoints**: `/api/search`, `/api/search/vector`, `/api/search/hybrid`
- **Root Cause**: Missing PostgreSQL functions `search_with_highlight` and `find_similar_vectors`
- **Fix Required**:
  - Run database migration to create missing functions
  - Verify pgvector extension is properly installed
  - Test full-text search configuration
  - Validate search queries with actual data

### 5.4 File Upload Pipeline Failures - HIGH
**Problem**: File upload endpoint `/api/files/upload` returns 500 error
- **Error**: Multipart boundary parsing issues
- **Root Cause**: Controller expects different multipart format than tests provide
- **Fix Required**:
  - Fix FileUploadController multipart handling
  - Add proper `@RequestPart` annotations
  - Test with actual file uploads from frontend
  - Add comprehensive error messages for debugging

### 5.5 Empty Search Validation - MEDIUM
**Problem**: Empty search query returns 500 instead of 400 Bad Request
- **Current**: Throws internal exception for empty query
- **Expected**: Return 400 with validation error message
- **Fix Required**:
  - Add `@NotBlank` validation to search query parameter
  - Handle validation exceptions in GlobalExceptionHandler
  - Return proper error response with message
  - Test all edge cases (null, empty, whitespace)

### 5.6 Integration Test Infrastructure - HIGH
**Problem**: Integration tests can't run properly
- **Issues**:
  - Tests trying to start own Spring context fail with database issues
  - Missing TestConfiguration class referenced everywhere
  - Test database not properly isolated from main database
- **Fix Required**:
  - Create proper TestConfiguration class
  - Use @TestPropertySource for test database
  - Consider using Testcontainers for PostgreSQL
  - Separate integration tests from unit tests properly

### 5.7 OpenAI API Dependency - MEDIUM
**Problem**: Embedding generation requires OpenAI API key but not documented
- **Impact**: Ingestion pipeline may fail without API key
- **Current**: MockEmbeddingService used but real service expects OpenAI
- **Fix Required**:
  - Make OpenAI optional with fallback to mock embeddings
  - Document API key requirement clearly
  - Add configuration flag to disable embeddings
  - Consider local embedding model alternative

### 5.8 Database Connection Issues - HIGH
**Problem**: Application expects database on wrong port
- **Current Config**: Port 5433 in application.yml
- **Docker Default**: PostgreSQL usually on 5432
- **Fix Required**:
  - Standardize on port 5432
  - Update docker-compose.yml and application.yml
  - Add environment variable override capability
  - Document port configuration clearly

### Implementation Priority:
1. **Immediate** (Blocks all functionality):
   - Fix database schema issues (5.1)
   - Fix search functionality (5.3)
   - Fix file upload (5.4)

2. **High** (Major features broken):
   - Sync NodeType enums (5.2)
   - Fix database connection (5.8)
   - Fix integration tests (5.6)

3. **Medium** (Quality improvements):
   - Fix validation errors (5.5)
   - Document/fix OpenAI dependency (5.7)
